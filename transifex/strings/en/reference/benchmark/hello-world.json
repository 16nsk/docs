Many people don't like this kind of benchmark because real-world applications require more complex features or structures. However, these tests identify the minimum time spent by each framework to perform a simple task. Such a task represents the minimum requirement for every framework to process a single request.",
    "hello-world_e097d55e97d0ff4d888a1c2a9eed5357": "More specifically, the benchmark only measures the time it takes for a framework to start, run an action and free up resources at the end of the request. Any PHP application based on an MVC architecture will require this time. Due to the simplicity of the benchmark, we ensure that the time needed for a more complex request will be higher.",
    "hello-world_49ec9562ad77b0b76cf7d70688d2933b": "A controller and a view have been created for each framework. The controller \"say\" and action \"hello\". The action only sends data to the view which displays it (\"Hello!\"). Using the \"ab\" benchmark tool we sent 2000 requests using 10 concurrent connections to each framework.",
