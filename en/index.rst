Welcome
========

Hi, welcome to Phalcon framework, a new approach on PHP frameworks. Our mission is to give you an advanced tool for developing web sites and applications without beign worried about losing performance. 

What is Phalcon?
----------------

Phalcon is an open source, full stack framework for PHP 5 written as a C-extension providing high performance. You don't need learn or use C language, the functionality is exposed as PHP classes you can use any time. Phalcon is also loose coupled thus you can select specific parts of the framework for your development.
Phalcon is not only about performance, our goal is to make it robust and easy to use!
